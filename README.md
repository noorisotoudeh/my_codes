# Qiagen
this repository is to show some sample codes for 
# 1- single cell rna-seq
in this directory you can find the notebooks for data analysis used for single cell rna-seq data in [ETP-ALL](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/137/18/2463/474247/Single-cell-RNA-seq-reveals-developmental) or [myeloma](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00766-y) paper. Note that, since these analysis has been done when popular package Seurat was not as developed as what it is now, the functions like SCTransform didn't use and instead SingleCellExperiment objects and its related packages applied for the most of analysis.
# 2- bulk rna-seq
there is one notebook that shows how use Deseq2 package for bulk rna samples.
# 3- milti omics
here I will show how to use combined scRNA-seq and single cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) to create gene regulatory networks.
# 4- shiny app
this is a development of shinycell package and it gives you an example i spatial ATAC-seq data analysis.
